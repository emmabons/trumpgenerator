# Trump Tweet Generator

During the Course 'Frontend for Designers', I learned how to make prototypes with HTML, CSS and Javascript to test design ideas in a webbrowser.

For this project I used the [Tronald Dump](https://www.tronalddump.io/) API to nostalgically load in random tweets form good ol' Donald Trump. Some points I put some extra attention to:

- Responsiveness
- Easter egg
- Dark mode

Access the prototype [right here](emmabons.github.io/trumpgenerator).
