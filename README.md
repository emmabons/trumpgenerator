# Trump Tweet Generator

During the Course 'Frontend for Designers', I learned how to make prototypes with HTML, CSS and Javascript to test design ideas in a webbrowser.

For this project I used the [Tronald Dump API](https://www.tronalddump.io/) to nostalgically load in random tweets from good ol' Donald Trump. I tried to make the UI as close to Twitters as possible to make you feel as if the ex-president hasn't actually been banned from the platform and make it seem as if we have never not been able to enjoy his fooly 280 character writings. 

Some points I paid some extra attention to during this project were:

- Responsiveness (forgive me, it still might work best using Chrome. But I definitely gained some responsive experience)
- Easter eggs
- Dark mode
